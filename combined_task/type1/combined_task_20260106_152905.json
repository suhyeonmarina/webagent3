  "scenario": "You run a small online shop based in Manhattan (zip 10019). A buyer in Los Angeles (zip 90028) is returning an item and you need to estimate the FedEx Ground cost for the 3-pound return, locate a staffed FedEx location near 10019 to drop off the return, and verify the return label scan by looking up tracking info for shipment #3023858502. At the same time, your supplier in Texas is preparing a 4-pound replacement to ship to New York, so you also want to calculate that shipping cost to reconcile refund and replacement shipping charges.",
