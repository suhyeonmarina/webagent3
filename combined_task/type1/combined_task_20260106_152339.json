I want to (1) see what other pregnant people have recently shared about pregnancy fever, (2) calculate my newborn son's growth percentiles using his birth measurements, and (3) check a height prediction for my seven-year-old daughter based on her current measurements and our family heights so I can review everything before my next pediatric/OB appointment.",
  "combined_task": "Gather recent community experiences about pregnancy fever and evaluate my children's growth—calculate my newborn son's birth percentiles and predict my seven-year-old daughter's future height—so I can discuss health and development concerns with care providers.",

    "Show me community posts about pregnancy fever from the past 30 days.",
    "My baby boy was born on Dec 1, 2025. His weight is 7 lb 8 oz, height is 20 inches, and head circumference is 35 cm. The measurement date is Dec 1, 2025. Can you calculate his growth percentiles using a calculator?",
    "See the prediction about the girl child's height, whose current height at seven years is 4 feet and whose weight is 55 lbs, her mother is 5 feet 2, and her father is 5 feet 8."
